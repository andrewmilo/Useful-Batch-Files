# Quick-Start
I have this script set to autorun when Windows loads up. At the press of a key, I'm able to instantly start up any applications that I register in the apps.txt file.

How to use:
# Edit the apps.txt file
  - First value is the keypress. Only A-Z and 1-9 are currently allowed.
  - Second value is a name.
  - Third value is the path to the file.
  
# Run the .bat file
  - Press a key and the file(s) will load.
  - The .bat file currently closes after 1 keypress.
